## The Multidimensional Twist

The unique twist in nPong is that the ball can pass through portals that transport it to different dimensions, each with their own distinct physics and visual styles:

1. **Prime Dimension** - Classic pong physics with standard gravity and friction
2. **Floaty Dimension** - Low gravity environment with ball trails and smoother movement
3. **Heavy Dimension** - High gravity, high friction dimension with intense bounces
4. **Chaos Dimension** - Unpredictable physics with chaotic particle effects

Each dimension has:
- Unique visual effects and background styles
- Different gravity and friction values
- Special particle effects for collisions
- Varied ball trail lengths and portal frequencies
